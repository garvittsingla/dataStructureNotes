# Recursion

## When a function call itself to perform a repetitive task is known as Recursive functions

There is a base case which specifes when to stop the function otherwise the function will call itself indefinetly and then a common error known as ```stack overflow``` will come when a programme takes more memory that is assigned to it
Watch [What happens during stackoverflow on yt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6zAAhkU_Iw)

This can be simplified by recursion tree and exaplained through it in detail
